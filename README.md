# A program to mimic a voter registration terminal and a voting machine.
# The voter registration portion allows a user to enter the following information and the system should provide a registration code:
# -First Name
# -Last Name
# -Address (city, state)
# - SNNO (900*******)
# Once all fields are entered and the User is NOT alreaty registered, the Registration token is assigned.
# A registration code can be looked up for any registered person by SSN and City name.
# Users must give their registration code to access the voting screen and they can only vote ONCE.
